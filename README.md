# **Prediction laptop price**
### *Training the model*

In this project, we are training a model which predicts the price of the laptop. The dataset in completely modified which i have done in preprocessing notebook and we are using it in our model training notebook.

It is a regression problem hence, We are using the following regression models:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
- SVR
- KNN Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- Ridge Regressor
- Lasso Regressor
- Extra Trees Regressor
